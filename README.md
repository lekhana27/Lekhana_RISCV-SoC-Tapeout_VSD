# 🖥️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey – VSD Program

This program provides **end-to-end exposure of Synopsys VCS → Design Compiler → Sign-off → Fab**.  
Welcome to my documentation of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository captures my weekly progress as I complete various tasks, from RTL design to GDSII generation, using open-source EDA tools.

> This program provides hands-on experience in designing a System-on-Chip (SoC) as part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative.  
> With 3500+ participants, this program aims to empower the next generation of engineers to contribute to the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.
